SLIDE 8 : AsciiDoc
----
* So What is AsciiDoc?

* AsciiDoc is two things:
** Plain-text format for notes, articles, documentation, books, e-books, etc.
** Text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various formats like PDF, HTML and others.

== AsciiDoc: *Lightweight markup*

[source, asciidoc]
----
= Document Title2
Doc Writer <doc@asciidoc.org>
v1.0, 2013-01-01: Initial version

http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] is a lightweight markup language.

This is the optional preamble (an untitled section body), useful for
writing simple sectionless documents consisting only of a preamble.

NOTE: The abstract, preface, appendix, bibliography, glossary and
index section titles are significant (_specialsections_).

== First section

Document sections start at *level 1* and can nest four levels deep.

* Item 1
* Item 2

====
----
SLIDE 9 : example
----
* so here is an example.
* this is just plain text
* you see a couple of annotations
* the first thing is just the title    
* then we have a paragraph 
* then we have an other section 
* AsciiDoc gets us back to what’s important: *WRITING.*

* It’s a syntax that a human can actually edit and read.

"Use _AsciiDoc_ for document markup. It's actually _readable_ by humans, _easier to parse_ and more flexible than XML."
-- Linus Torvalds

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 10 : Linus Torvalds
----
* Why do you need to use AsciiDoc for documentation... BECAUSE Linus Torvalds said it.

* So seriously, AsciiDoc works because:
** It’s readable
** It’s concise
** It’s comprehensive
** It’s extensible
** It produces beautiful output (HTML, PDF, EPUB and more)

* Regarding the other office tools, AsciiDoc gives you the ability to
follow almost the same workflow that you have when writing code:
** refactor the documentation
** do a simple diff on documentation

* It looks like code, you can check it on the source code revising control.

== What's *Asciidoctor*?

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 11 : Asciidoctor
----
* Remember what I said earlier.
* AsciiDoc is not really new. 
* It's Python based but there is a new tools since 2012, which is ruby based.
* There are ways to run it inside the JVM. This is Asciidoctor.

----
SLIDE 12 : Asciidoctor
----
* Asciidoctor is a modern open-source implementation of AsciiDoc, written in Ruby.
* The idea is : 
** we have a AsciiDoc document
** we have an AsciiDoc processor
** we put the document to the processor
** and VOILA => it comes out as HTML

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 13 : Output
----
* So what can Asciidoctor make?
* Asciidoctor can do HTML5, DocBook, PDF, EPUB, and MOBI
* Asciidoctor can do slides like this deck, as well as man pages
* and most important "anything you want"
** you can plug in your own backend so the HTML that you get, is not the HTML that you have to have 
**  Asciidoctor built a document Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), not too different to our source code (when we have classes and methods) 
** so you have the ability to manipulate the document and you can create whatever you want

[.topic]
== How do I *use* Asciidoctor?

[.incremental]
* Ruby [detail]#asciidoctor, asciidoctor-pdf#
* Java [detail]#asciidoctorj, asciidoctor-maven-plugin#
* Groovy [detail]#asciidoctor-gradle-plugin#
* Javascript [detail]#asciidoctor.js, Chrome/Firefox extension#

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 14 : Polyglot
----
* The main project is Asciidoctor, implemented in Ruby. 
** asciidoctor-pdf is a native PDF renderer for AsciiDoc built with Asciidoctor and prawn. AsciiDoc direct to PDF.
* So, OK, it's Ruby, but Ruby runs on the JVM thanks to JRuby!!
** There is another project called AsciidoctorJ which is a wrapper on top of plain Asciidoctor using JRuby
so you do not need Ruby to run Asciidoctor, you just need Java
** And from there we can construct any other tools based on the JVM that consumes AsciidoctorJ and in this case we have a maven plugin and a gradle plugin
* You can also run Asciidoctor through JavaScript, Ruby has a transpiler call Opal. Opal transforms Ruby code into Javascript code so you can run Asciidoctor on the browser or anywhere that Javascript can be run.
** There is also a Chrome extension and a Firefox addon
* So we have a POLYGLOT environment here

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 15 : Who uses it
----
* So Asciidoctor is a really new project but it's already much used, in fact we have
** some frameworks which generates their technical documentation with Asciidoctor like Spring, Infinispan and others
** There is already 1 JSR which used Asciidoctor : CDI specification
** there are also some publisher like O'Reilly (enterprise Web Book)
** some repositories like GitHub, in fact you can write your doc file like README with AsciiDoc and you will see the rendered HTML

====
----
SLIDE 16 : DEMO asciidoctor.js
----
* Now let's try a demo
* Local : prepare a server
* DEMO :
. Present the ad-editor
.. on the left side, you have the AsciiDoc editor based on angular-ui-ace-editor
.. on the top of the screen, you have the navbar which tells you if you are working online or offline
.. in this case we are on offline mode since we just want to use Asciidoctor through asciidoctor.js, so we don't need the server to be started.
.. on the right side, we have the HTML5 rendered view, so here is the HTML5 generated by Opal.js and asciidoctor.js
. so let's go to the demo
.. do a drag and drop (HTML5) with the demo1.adoc
.. render it with Alt+R
.. change mode to "on change"
.. add a title before the first section
.. copy/paste source code to show highlight
.. talk about HTML5 features like storage with indexedDB, drag and drop

CONCLUDE:

* OK that was the demo in order to show how Asciidoctor works with asciidoctor.js and some HTML5 features like drag and drop and storage with IndexedDB.

== HTTP

* half-duplex
* verbose
* hack for server push

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 20 : HTTP
----
* HTTP is the standard protocol for the Web, it's very effective for a lot of use cases but there are some basics issues with HTTP:

* HTTP is a Half-duplex protocol :
** the client initiate  : the Client send a request to the server, server processes the request, it generates the response and send it back to the client
** there is no way for the server to say : "hey I have some information that I want to send to you"
* HTTP is a verbose protocol:
** even if you want to send a simple hello world message ; 
** the problem is that those request/response are typically generated by browser and app server, and they want to send a whole bunch of information 
* server push : server has no way to tell to client  "I have some data and I want to push it to you"

* HTTP is well but there is some limitations.
* So for interactive Web Site, HTTP is  inefficient, wasteful and complex

"WebSocket is a _full-duplex_ _bi-directional_ protocol, over a _Single TCP Connection_."
-- Arun Gupta, Red Hat

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 21 : Definition
----
* A very simple one line definition for WebSocket is : "...."
* it's full duplex : because client can send to server and server to client independent of each other
* it's bi-directional : that means a client can send a message to server and a server can send a message to client, so both ways, that's bidirectionnal protocol
* the best part is : it is over a single TCP connection 
** for every HTTP connection, there is a new TCP connection that is being initiated , yes there is HTTP keep alive and things like that but application can not rely on keep-alive..

* HTTP specification by itself define how you can upgrade a protocol.
* it says you have a HTTP protocol, you send me a couple of headers as part of the request then I will upgraded to other HTTP protocol or other protocol

* We will use this HTTP upgrade mechanism and upgrade from HTTP to WebSocket.
but once the HTTP connection and underline TCP connection are upgraded to a websocket is like opening a socket over the Internet. We can exchange infinite amount of messages until one of them say "I'm done, I don't want to talk anymore"

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 22 : 3 things
----
When we talk about WebSocket, there are 2 concepts we talk about
- one is a protocol, the protocol by itself means how does under wire format look like.
In WebSocket you have a protocol that is define by RFC 6455, this is about a three years old protocol now, you can search for the document and that will tell you exactly how the protocol looks like. 

it define exactly how the frames look like.

It's a very lean protocol, there is only a 2 byte of overhead basically says : it's text data or binary data AND then it says its a control frame or a data frame. so it's not a lot of overhead.

then It also defines how the upgrade mechanism is gonna look like.

- when you are building a WebSocket application, you are most likely building a web application, so W3C has define a Javascript API

        }

----

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 27 : Java API sample
----
* So let's take a look how does a very trivial example looks like.
* I have my public class EchoServer over here and here I have a simple method which takes a parameter message, concatenate it and return a String paramter.
* So How do I make it a WebSocket Server Endpoint ?
** You just need to add that simple @ServerEndpoint annotation, you don't need deployment descriptor at all. Of course you nedd to specify the URI on where the endpoint is gonna be to listen, so here is the URI
** Then when you have your server endpoint, you want to receive messages and then you want to call some of your business method and that method is being identify by adding @OnMessage annotation.

* So here whenever a client calls this WebSocket Endpoint at the URI /echo, we call this businness method and it is a text payload that is being received, it is mapped to String, concatenate it and then return the response back.

* We talk about that WebSocket is only one way messages, so effectively this API is allowing you to program standard Java application and under the wire, the server receive the request from client, it processes the response, generate a new message and send it from server to  client.

** the differences between thoses 2 annotations is that Server Endpoint is listening to a URL so you have to specify the URI but as a Client Endpoint doesn't listen for a request, so there is no URI parameter for @ClientEndpoint annotation 
* We already talk about @OnMessage

JSON format with JSON-P API
* <3> : we define an encoder in order to transform the JSON that you saw in the previous slide

== Asciidoctor *AST* Transformation

[.incremental]
* Asciidoctor -> *AST feature*...
* easy to render *one part* of the document...
*  and we can render *HTML5 slides*... 
* and we have the *WebSocket protocol*...

SLIDE 37 : AST
----
* Remember that I said that Asciidoctor provide an AST (Abstract syntax tree) feature. 
* So that means that you can do a lot of things with the document
like render only a selected part of it. 
* Plus Asciidoctor can render slides, 
* Plus; we have WebSocket which provide a full-duplex bi-directional protocol...

* Thank you. I hope that this presentation was great.
* We have a couple of minutes, are there any questions ?

* Questions :
** WebSocket
*** security => like servlet protocol + wss
*** scalability => based on TCP connection so on open file limit on linux (1 Million)

** adeditor
*** why don't let the browser processing the AsciiDoc
