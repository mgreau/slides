SLIDE 8 : AsciiDoc
----
* So What is AsciiDoc ?

* AsciiDoc is two things:
** plain-text format for notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, etc
** A text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various formats like PDF, HTML and others

== AsciiDoc : *Lightweight markup*

[source, asciidoc]
----
= Document Title2
Doc Writer <doc@asciidoc.org>
v1.0, 2013-01-01: Initial version

http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] is a lightweight markup language.

This is the optional preamble (an untitled section body), useful for
writing simple sectionless documents consisting only of a preamble.

NOTE: The abstract, preface, appendix, bibliography, glossary and
index section titles are significant (_specialsections_).

== First section

Document sections start at *level 1* and can nest four levels deep.

* Item 1
* Item 2
----

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
----
SLIDE 9 : example
----
* so here is an example.
* this is just plain text
* you see a couple of annotations
* the first thing is just the title    
* then we have a paragraph 
* then we have an other section 
* AsciiDoc gets us back to what’s important: *WRITING.*

* It’s a syntax that a human can actually edit and read.

"Use _AsciiDoc_ for document markup. It's actually _readable_ by humans, _easier to parse_ and more flexible than XML."
-- Linus Torvald

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 10 : Linus Torvald
----
* Why do you need to use AsciiDoc for documentation... BECAUSE Linus Torvald said it.

* So seriously, AsciiDoc works because:
** It’s readable
** It’s concise
** It’s comprehensive
** It’s extensible
** It produces beautiful output (HTML, PDF, ePub and more)

* Regarding to the other office tools, AsciiDoc gives you the possibility to
follow almost the same workflow that you have when writing code :
** refactor the documentation
** do a simple diff on documentation

* It looks like code, you can check it on the source code revising control.

== What's *Asciidoctor* ?

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 11 : Asciidoctor
----
* Remember what I said earlyier.
* AsciiDoc is not really new. 
* It's Python based but theres is a new tools since 2012, which is ruby based.
* There are ways to run it inside the JVM. This is Asciidoctor.

----
SLIDE 12 : Asciidoctor
----
* Asciidoctor is a modern open-source implementation of AsciiDoc, written in Ruby 
* The idea is : 
** we have a asciidoc document
** we have an asciidoc processor
** we put the document to the processor
** and VOILA => it comes to HTML

== Output *formats* (i.e., backends)

* slides [detail]#deck.js, dzslides, reveal.js#
* man pages
* *custom*

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 13 : Output
----
* So what can Asciidoctor make ?
* Asciidoctor can do HTML5, DocBook, PDF, ePub, mobi
* Asciidoctor can do slides like this deck, can do man pages
* and most important "anything you want"
** you can plug in your own backend so the HTML that you get, is not the HTML that you have to have 
**  Asciidocotor built a document Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), not too different to our source code (when we have classes and methods) 
so you have the ability to manipulate the document and you can create whatever you want

[[slide14]]
[.topic]
== How do I *use* Asciidoctor ?

[.incremental]
* Ruby [detail]#asciidoctor asciidoctor-pdf#
* Java [detail]#asciidoctorJ, asciidoctor-maven-plugin#
* Groovy [detail]#asciidoctor-gradle-plugin#
* Javascript [detail]#asciidoctor.js, Chrome/Firefox extension#

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 14 : Polyglot
----
* The main project is asciidoctor, implemented in Ruby. 
** asciidoctor-pdf is a native PDF renderer for AsciiDoc built with asciidoctor and prawn. AsciiDoc direct to PDF.
* So, ok it's Ruby,  but Ruby runs on the JVM thanks to JRuby !!
** There is an other project called AsciidoctorJ which is a wrapper on top of plain asciidoctor using JRUby
so you do not need Ruby to run Asciidoctor, you just need Java
** And from there we can construct any other tools based on the JVM that consumes asciidoctorJ and in this case we have a maven plugin and a gradle plugin
* You can also run Asciidoctor throught Javascript, Ruby has a transpiler call Opal. Opal transforms Ruby code into Javascript code so you can run Asciidoctor on the browser or anywhere that Javascript can be run.
** There are also a Chrome extension and a Firefox addon
* So we have a POLYGLOT environment here

== *Who* is using Asciidoctor ?

* Frameworks [detail]#Spring, Infinispan#
* JSR [detail]#CDI Specifications#
* Publishers [detail]#O'Reilly#
* Repositories [detail]#Github, Bintray#
* and more...

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 15 : Who use it
----
* So Asciidoctor is a really new project but it's already much used, in fact we have
** some frameworks which generates their technical documentation with Asciidoctor like Spring, Infinispan and others
** There is already 1 JSR which used Asciidoctor : CDI specification
** there are also some publisher like O'Reilly (enterprise Web Book)
** some repositories like Github, in fact you can write your doc file like README with AsciiDoc and you will see the rendered HTML

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 16 : DEMO asciidoctor.js
----
* Now let's try a demo
* Local : prepare a server
* Online : http://tinyurl.com/adeditor
* DEMO :
. Present the ad-editor
.. on the left side, you have the AsciiDoc editor based on angular-ui-ace-editor
.. on the top of the screen, you have the navbar which tells you if you are working online or offline
.. in this case we are on offline mode since we just want to use Asciidoctor through asciidoctor.js, so we don't need the server to be started.
.. on the right side, we have the HTML5 rendered view, so here is the HTML5 generated by Opal.js and asciidoctor.js
. so let's goto the demo
.. do a drag and drop (HTML5) with the demo1.adoc
.. render it with Alt+R
.. change mode to "on change"
.. add a title before the first section
.. copy/paste source code to show higlight
.. talk about HTML5 features like storage with indexedDB, drag and drop

CONCLUDE:
* Ok that was the demo in order to show how Asciidoctor works with asciidoctor.js and some HTML5 features like drag and drop and storage with IndexedDB.

** You will find all sources on github for asciidoctor, asciidoctor.js, asciidoctorJ and so on

== HTTP

* half-duplex
* verbose
* hack for server push

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 20 : HTTP
----
* HTTP is the standard protocol for the Web, it's very effective for a lot of use cases but there are some basics issues with HTTP:

* HTTP is a Half-duplex protocol :
** the client initiate  : the Client send a request to the server, server processes the request, it generates the response and send it back to the client
** there is no way for the server to say : "hey I have some information that I want to send to you"
* HTTP is a verbose protocol:
** even if you want to send a simple hello world message ; 
** the problem is that thoses request/response are typically generated by browser and app server, and they want to send a whole bunch of information 
* server push : server has no way to tell to client  "I have some datas and I want to push it to you"

* HTTP is well but there is some limitations.
* So for interactive Web Site, HTTP is  inefficient, wasteful and complex

"WebSocket is a _full-duplex_ _bi-directional_ protocol, over a _Single TCP Connection_."
-- Arun Gupta (RedHat)

[NOTE.speaker]
====
----
SLIDE 21 : Definition
----
This is why the *new WebSocket protocol* offers more advanced features than HTTP because it is:

* based on *+1 unique TCP connection between 2 peers+* (whereas each HTTP request/response needs a new TCP connection)
* *+bidirectionnal+* : client can send message to server and server can also send message to client
* *+full-duplex+* : client can send multiple messages to server, as well as server to client without waiting for a response from each other

'The term *client* is used only to define the one that initiate the connection. Once the connection is established, client and server become both *peers*, with the same capacity.'

The WebSocket protocol was originally intended to be part of the HTML5 specification but as HTML5 will be

SLIDE 37 : AST
----
* Remember that I said that Asciidoctor provide an AST (Abstract syntax tree) feature. 
* So that means that you can do a lot of things with the document
like render only a selected part of it. 
* Plus Asciidoctor can render slides, 
* Plus; we have WebSocket which provide a full-duplex bi-directional protocol...

SLIDE 41 : Thank YOU
----
* Thank you. I hope that this session 
* We have a couple of minutes, is there any questions ?

* Questions :
** WebSocket
*** security => like servlet protocol + wss
*** scalability => based on TCP connection so on open file limit on linux (1 Million)

** adeditor
*** why don't let the browser processing the asciidoc
